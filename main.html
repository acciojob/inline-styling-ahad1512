		<p>Flowers have petals. Inside the part of the flower that has petals are the parts which produce pollen and seeds. In all plants, a flower is usually its most colourful part. We say the plant 'flowers', 'is flowering' or 'is in flower' when this colourful part begins to grow bigger and open out.</p>
